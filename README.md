**Activision Server Issue**

Activision has made all accounts private by default. So in order to use this
website you must first go to https://s.activision.com/activision/login and login.
Go to your account and set "searchable" and "Data visible" to "none". Refresh the page
and set both fields to "all" and refresh the page (do this regardless if the fields were
already set to "all"). It should take about 10-15min to activiate and your account shoudld be accessable
on this site.
